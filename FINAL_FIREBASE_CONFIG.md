# Complete Firebase Configuration

All credentials have been extracted and are ready for configuration. Here are the exact environment variables to set:

## Environment Variables (Copy and Paste)



## What Happens After Configuration

Once these environment variables are set and the application restarts:

1. **Login Page Changes**: Users will see two tabs:
   - üåê **Google Login** (new!)
   - üîë **Standard Login** (existing)

2. **Google Authentication Flow**:
   - Click "Sign in with Google"
   - Redirect to Google's secure login
   - User grants permissions
   - Automatic return to application
   - Instant authentication with user profile

3. **User Management**:
   - First Google user becomes admin automatically
   - Google users sync with local database
   - Same JWT tokens as standard users
   - Full access to all system features

4. **Enhanced Security**:
   - Google's enterprise-grade authentication
   - No password storage for Google users
   - OAuth 2.0 standard compliance
   - Automatic email verification

## Configuration Steps

1. **Set Environment Variables**: Copy the values above to your Replit Secrets
2. **Restart Application**: The system will detect the new configuration
3. **Test Google Login**: Try signing in with a Google account
4. **Verify Integration**: Check that user appears in admin panel

## Security Notes

- Private keys contain sensitive data - keep secure
- OAuth credentials allow Google sign-in access
- First user to authenticate (Google or standard) becomes admin
- All security features remain active with Google authentication

## Troubleshooting

If Google login doesn't appear:
1. Verify all 5 environment variables are set exactly as shown
2. Check for extra spaces or missing characters
3. Restart the application completely
4. Look for Firebase initialization messages in logs

## Ready to Deploy

With these credentials configured, your Enterprise RAG System will have:
- Professional dual authentication
- Google single sign-on capability
- Enterprise-grade security
- Seamless user experience
